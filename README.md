# Predicting Student Performance with K-Nearest Neighbors Regression

![Cover Image](https://github.com/Brianhulela/k_nearest_neighbors_grades_regression/blob/master/plot.png)

This repository demonstrates how to use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression model to predict student performance based on various features such as socioeconomic status, study hours, sleep hours, and attendance.

The dataset used in this project contains data on student performance and is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/larsen0966/student-performance-data-set). The goal is to train a KNN model to predict students' final grades based on these factors.  

### Key Features of the Repository:
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned, and the features are scaled to prepare for KNN regression.
- **Model Training**: The KNN regression model is trained using a training dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score to measure the prediction accuracy.
- **Visualization**: The results are visualized using scatter plots to compare actual vs. predicted grades and a residual plot to assess prediction errors.

The medium article associated with this repository provides more details on the implementation and insights about using KNN for regression tasks. You can read the full article [here](https://medium.com/@brianhulela/using-k-nearest-neighbors-for-student-performance-regression-fd5c58155c06).

Explore the code, try it out with different datasets, and experiment with KNN to see how it works for your predictive modeling tasks!
